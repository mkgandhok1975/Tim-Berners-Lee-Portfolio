        It was on June 8, 1955, when Tim Berners-Lee was born in London, England, United Kingdom. His parents were Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee who both worked in the first commercially built computer which was the Ferranti Mark 1. He also has a brother named Mike who’s an expert on greenhouse gases.

Tim attended Sheen Mount Primary School then from 1969 to 1973, went to attend southwest London’s Emanuel School. He was a keen railway enthusiast when he was younger that’s why he learned about electronics from playing with a model railway. From 1973 to 1976, he studied at the Queen’s College, Oxford where he received a first-class bachelor of arts degree in physics. During his college years, he made a computer out of an old television set that he got from a repair shop.


 
After he graduated college, Tim Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at Plessey which was a telecommunications company in Poole, Dorset. He then joined D.G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset in 1978 where he helped in creating type-setting software for printers.

From June to December 1980, Tim worked as an independent contractor at CERN. While he was in Geneva, he proposed a project about the concept of hypertext to enable sharing and updating information among researchers. To be able to demonstrate this proposal, he created a prototype system which was called ENQUIRE.


 
He left CERN in late 1980 and worked at John Poole’s Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset where he ran the company’s technical side for three years. He worked on a project called, “real-time remote procedure call”, that gave him experience in computer networking. Tim then returned to CERN in 1984 as a fellow.

CERN became the largest internet node in Europe in 1989 and that’s the time when Tim saw the opportunity to join hypertext with the internet.
